        <li>3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 (3/8 ounce) beef bouillon cube</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/3 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>1 (32-ounce) package refrigerated mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>chopped chives for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground chuck; cook, stirring to crumble beef into small pieces, until browned, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat, spoon drippings into a small bowl. Let drippings cool, then discard. </li>
        <li>Add onion to skillet; cook over medium, stirring often, until onions have softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in bouillon, sugar, mustard, and pepper until well combined. Stir in crushed tomatoes, ketchup, broth, tomato paste, and Worcestershire sauce until well combined. Bring to a simmer over medium-high; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.  </li>
        <li>Spoon mashed potatoes over beef mixture in skillet and gently spread into an even layer to cover beef completely.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle evenly with cheeses.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are heated through and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil; do not remove skillet. Broil until cheese is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes; garnish with chives, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
